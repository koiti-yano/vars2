# vars2
**Vector Autoregression Models (a modified version of vars)**

The package vars by Bernhard Pfaff is a perfect tool for time series analysis, and many reseaechers and practitioners on the area love it in the past 18 years. I also love it so much. Recently, I found that many reseaechers and practitioners prefer tibble than ts and ggplot2 than base-plot.

To solove the problem, I am planning to modify the vars for using tibble and ggplot2. Now I'm calling the modified version vars2.
