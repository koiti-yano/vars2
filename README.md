# vars2
**Vector Autoregression Models (a modified version of vars)**

The package vars by Bernhard Pfaff is an excellent tool for time series analysis, and many researchers and practitioners in the field have loved it for the past 18 years. I also hold it in high regard.

Recently, Iâ€™ve noticed that many researchers and practitioners prefer tibble over ts and ggplot2 over base plot. To address this preference, I am planning to modify vars to utilize tibble and ggplot2. The modified version of vars is now being referred to as vars2.
